## Run locally
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```
Then open <http://localhost:8000>.

## Capture a screenshot
Because this repository is pure static HTML, you can capture a UI screenshot from any browser without extra dependencies:
1. Start the local server (`python -m http.server 8000`).
2. Open <http://localhost:8000> in your browser.
3. Use your browser's built-in screenshot feature (or OS-level screenshot hotkey) and save the image.
